# Lockers

If a student is on a study term and has paid their MathSoc fee, they are eligible to book a locker for the period of the term. **No perishable foods are allowed to be stored to avoid attracting pests**.

MathSoc offers lockers on a term-by-term basis, first-come-first-serve. For Fall 2025, locker sign outs will be available starting **September 6th for math students** who have paid their MathSoc fee, and **September 28th for non-math students** who have paid their MathSoc fee.

**Locker signouts are open for all MathSoc fee-paying students via [this form](https://forms.gle/9Bp2M3sh6siRansV8).**
