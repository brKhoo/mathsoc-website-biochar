## First Year Representative Candidates

### Yu Qiao

Hi, I’m Ryan Qiao (pronounced like Bella “Ciao”), an ordinary CS student who enjoys FPS, escape rooms, and travelling (>ᴗ-). I’m a math/CS nerd—but trust me—I touch grass every day (^_^). In high school, I served as a student council exec, math club president, and science club treasurer, where I learned to listen, budget, and organize. I’m fluent in English and Chinese, and I know a bit of Japanese, which helps me hear more voices. It’s easy to find me online or around UWP. I’ll gather your ideas, bring them to MathSoc Council, and keep you in the loop.

### Kshaunish Gupta

Starting university is a big step for all of us, and I know how important it is to feel welcomed and supported. I am Kshaunish Gupta, and I want MathSoc to be a place where every first year feels heard, valued, and connected. I aim for more social events, stronger academic support, and more open communication. Vote for me if you want to build a first-year experience we can all be proud of.

### Catherine Chen

First year can be tough, but choosing your first-year rep isn't! As your rep, I will bring your voices forward and advocate for all your needs. From fun events to real representation, I'll make sure your first year is as unforgettable as your 135 midterm :)

∀ first-year candidates, ∃ a unique candidate s.t. your voices are heard ∧ your needs are advocated ∧ unforgettable year ⟺ Catherine as your first year rep!

### Utkarsh Goel

I’m running for Council to amplify student voices, streamline campus services, and host inclusive events. I’ll champion clear communication, transparency, and practical, affordable improvements that save time for everyone. If elected, I’ll listen first, act fairly, and collaborate with you to build a more connected campus. Learn more and vote at vote.wusa.ca
