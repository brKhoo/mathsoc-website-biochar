## First Year Representative Candidates

### Ryan Qiao

Hi, I’m Ryan Qiao (pronounced like Bella “Ciao”), an ordinary CS student who enjoys FPS, escape rooms, and travelling (>ᴗ-). I’m a math/CS nerd—but trust me—I touch grass every day (^_^). In high school, I served as a student council exec, math club president, and science club treasurer, where I learned to listen, budget, and organize. I’m fluent in English and Chinese, and I know a bit of Japanese, which helps me hear more voices. It’s easy to find me online or around UWP. I’ll gather your ideas, bring them to MathSoc Council, and keep you in the loop.

### Kshaunish Gupta

Starting university is a big step for all of us, and I know how important it is to feel welcomed and supported. I am Kshaunish Gupta, and I want MathSoc to be a place where every first year feels heard, valued, and connected. I aim for more social events, stronger academic support, and more open communication. Vote for me if you want to build a first-year experience we can all be proud of.
