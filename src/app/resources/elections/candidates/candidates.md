## President Candidates

### Veertej Sehdave

Hey everyone! I’m Veer, and I’m heading into my 3rd year, majoring in Statistics (finally locking that in soon). Some of you might recognize me from WUSA, where I currently serve as the Coordinator for the International and Canadian Student Network (ICSN), organizing large student events, handling logistics, and helping connect students from all backgrounds across campus.

Through that experience, I’ve learned how to manage teams, budgets, and way too many email chains, but more importantly, how to make student life just a bit more connected and easier. I’m running for MathSoc President because I want to keep building spaces where our ideas actually turn into action, and where students feel like MathSoc works for them, not just around them.

If you ever want to chat about MathSoc, course pain, or just hang out, I’m always around!
