## First Year Representative Candidates

### Yu Qiao

Hi, I’m Ryan Qiao (pronounced like Bella “Ciao”), an ordinary CS student who enjoys FPS, escape rooms, and travelling (>ᴗ-). I’m a math/CS nerd—but trust me—I touch grass every day (^_^). In high school, I served as a student council exec, math club president, and science club treasurer, where I learned to listen, budget, and organize. I’m fluent in English and Chinese, and I know a bit of Japanese, which helps me hear more voices. It’s easy to find me online or around UWP. I’ll gather your ideas, bring them to MathSoc Council, and keep you in the loop.

### Kshaunish Gupta

Starting university is a big step for all of us, and I know how important it is to feel welcomed and supported. I am Kshaunish Gupta, and I want MathSoc to be a place where every first year feels heard, valued, and connected. I aim for more social events, stronger academic support, and more open communication. Vote for me if you want to build a first-year experience we can all be proud of.

### Catherine Chen

First year can be tough, but choosing your first-year rep isn't! As your rep, I will bring your voices forward and advocate for all your needs. From fun events to real representation, I'll make sure your first year is as unforgettable as your 135 midterm :)

∀ first-year candidates, ∃ a unique candidate s.t. your voices are heard ∧ your needs are advocated ∧ unforgettable year ⟺ Catherine as your first year rep!

### Utkarsh Goel

Hey everyone! I’m Utkarsh, and I’m running to be your MathSoc First Year Representative. I believe our voices deserve to shape how MathSoc supports us — through improved academic resources, enhanced mentorship, and increased opportunities to connect and collaborate. My goal is to make MathSoc more transparent, inclusive, and responsive to what first-years truly need. Together, we can make our first year more engaging, empowering, and impactful. Vote 01 – Utkarsh Goel for practical goals and real results!

### Aeshaan Kumar

Hey! My name is Aeshaan Kumar, and the only thing I really aim for is to connect us all better. That's why I will be organizing group study sessions where we can discuss course notes' questions, and prepare for quizzes together. I will also initiate monthly surveys to ensure maximum communication between everyone.  I'd also love to have fun little quizzes that have nothing to do with coursework, but rather test our problem-solving skills. And who knows, maybe you'll get a chocolate if you win :) My goal is to ensure maximum connection, whether inside or outside the classroom.

### Ashni Danstan

By organizing engaging social events and promoting academic success, I aim to foster an environment where everyone can thrive, connect, and contribute. I am committed to making our math community stronger.
