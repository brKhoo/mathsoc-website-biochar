## Computer Science Representatives

- Avish Kathpal
- Awab Qureshi
- Grace Feng
- Ivy Fan-Chiang
- Tian Chen

Note: One candidate was disqualified because they did not submit an expense report. They were marked as “withdrawn” in the input for the program (and this can be seen in the output log), effectively removing them from the count. For this reason, the Computer Science Representative election had 75 ballots, but the output log indicates there were just 62. The program removed 13 ballots which included only the withdrawn candidate in their rankings.
